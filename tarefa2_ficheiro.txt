Hello! 
Welcome to the world of branching and merging.
In this assignment I'd like for you to create a new branch, commit a file to it, and merge it into master.
You'll need to follow these steps:
Create a new branch (and make sure you're working in the new branch)
Create a new file (could be anything!) and make a new commit with that file
Merge your new branch into master (but don't merge master into your new branch)
Good luck!
